### Task 1 – Data Understanding (Documentation)

In this `README.md` (or a separate `DATA_REPORT.md` if you prefer), briefly describe:

- The main entities in the dataset (see `data/` folder).
- **Data Quality**: Identify issues such as missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formatting (e.g., location names).
- **Schema**: Explain how you handled the `payload` field in the `events` table (Note: It contains JSON data).
- Assumptions you had to make.
